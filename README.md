Q5: Data Privacy - Data privacy is a big concern and important topic within organizations today. What are some data privacy best practices companies can take to help protect their data? 

A5: Data Privacy Best Practices
    
1.	Build a classification matrix to determine levels of security and “tag” each document according to its classification:
    a.	Public information is available to anyone
    b.	Internal Use documents can be shared with employees and external parties working under a contractual relationship. Any other parties must sign a Non-Disclose Agreement (NDA)
    c.	Confidential documents should remain internal only
    d.	Sensitive documents can only be shared with external recipients who have completed a Non-Disclose Agreement (NDA)
2.	Exchanging or storing “restricted” or “confidential” information should require encryption
3.	Review password strength requirements: 
    a.	Eight (8) character minimum 
    b.	Multi-component structure (i.e., upper/lower case letters, numbers, special characters, etc.)
    c.	Cannot use recent password (minimum #)
4.	Review password update requirements (60 days or less)
5.	Use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) when off premises and using 3rd party networks
6.	Privacy filters (for working in public locations; i.e., airports, hotels, cafes, etc.)
7.	Refrain from communicating “restricted” or “confidential” information in public
8.	Be aware of printing “restricted” or “confidential” information to unsecured/shared/public printers
9.	Disposal of “restricted” or “confidential” information should be shredded/securely erased
10.	Shut down/lock devices when not in use
11.	Backup data whenever possible/necessary
12.	Secure all “restricted” and/or “confidential” hard copies (including flipcharts and whiteboards) and storage devices when not in use
