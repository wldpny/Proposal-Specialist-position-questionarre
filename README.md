The Importance of Proposal and Security Content During the Sales Cycle 

Q1: What do you know about GitHub? What would you like to know (about the team, company, culture, etc)?

A1: GitHub is clearly a world I want to explore further and will continue to do so even if my application is not selected for the position. GitHub is EXACTLY what I have been searching for in my constant desire to expand my knowledge-base. 

In answer to the question, I would like to know how someone of my level (extreme-beginner) in all things "code," would be treated by the team, company, and culture. I am not shy; I ask questions, seek advice, attempt to do things on my own (sometimes finding new pathways and sometimes having to backtrack and "fix" things).
