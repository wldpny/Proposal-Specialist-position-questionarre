The Importance of Proposal and Security Content During the Sales Cycle 

Q6. Project/Program management capability: Often times, the people you need to count on to move your work forward have a lot on their plate. Aside from everyday tasks, they have multiple projects they are working on. Can you provide insight into how you organize and track work items across other teams and individuals and how would you work to collaborate with them to get your work completed by the required deadline given their busy schedules? 

A6:  Gaant charts can assist with the projected timeline of a project by tracking individual (and team) producers, materials, and processes (who does what, when). Online CRMs (iManage, Relativity, Salesforce, Symphony, SharePoint, etc.) can assist with tracking document versions and updates including the Gaant chart used to track the project timeline.

These resources can ensure that everyone on the project has a clear understanding of where each project milestone is in relation to their individual contributions and whether or not processes need to be re-evaluated at any stage of the timeline in order to successfully complete the project within the required guidelines and timeframe provided.
