Q4: Data Breach - Can you describe a time when a company had a data breach and describe how they handled it? 

A4: Bank of America was recently exposed to a data breach on an undisclosed number of bank cards/accounts whose account holders had recently visited a specific vendor. Actions taken to protect future access to those accounts affected included notifying the holders of all accounts affected by the breach and the immediate issuance of new cards to ensure no unauthorized activity could be taken against such accounts.
