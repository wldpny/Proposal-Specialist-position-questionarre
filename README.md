The Importance of Proposal and Security Content During the Sales Cycle 








Q2 What tools or technology do you use to stay organized? 

A2 In my current work I use Excel for catalogs, iManage (CRM) for client version control and tracking of documents, and a Windows directory of all my work requests (for tracking outside of the iManage platform; some clients do not save work to the platform but prefer to work locally) and work-related training documentation and communications.  In my personal life I use Excel for budgeting and a OneDrive directory for personal materials (music, artwork, writing, etc.), employment materials and communications, and training documentation.
